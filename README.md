## Rock Paper Scissors

This is a small front-end project for the ODIN Project curriculum of web development.
The game works like any classical 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game: the code generates a random number (either 0, 1 or 2) that stands for one of the three moves. This happens right after the player presses one of the three buttons. There's only 5 rounds of the game; whoever scores the most points in those 5 rounds wins. A point is given only for winning a round.

A table shows which hands the player and the computer did play, in addition to the current round number. Another table shows the current scores for the player and the computer.
